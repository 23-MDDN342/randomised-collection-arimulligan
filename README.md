## 2024 MDDN342 Assignment 2: Randomised Collections

**This is where you talk about your project!**

>This starter code is just some simple faces being drawn. 

In the first few weeks, I am deciding on creating different sheeps' faces with varying inputs. The inputs that I will be keeping the ame are the facial expressions - as I will be making a joyful sheep face in the middle with sadder faces going further out from these happier faces. 
Currently trying to work on the wool around the face to change. 

The purpose for doing this was to show someone who has the joy of the Lord set before them, and the light and love that they can share with the people around them. It is also how people who don't have Jesus in their life are lost sheep. 

I have now created my first happy sheep! I have finally decided on the parameters that I'll be using which are:
    fluffiList - a function which returns the random placement of the sheeps head fluff. This is not a parameter which can be used on the editor slider. I purposefully made the head fluff go above the guidelines, as the face itself has space underneath it for other sheeps' fluff to go over the lines.
    eyeSize - the size of the pupils, makes the sheep either look really tired or really high.
    faceSize - sheep all weigh differently just like us!
    ear_tilt - thought it looks cute if some are droopy and some are barely visible.
    pupilDirectionX, 
    pupilDirectionY, 
    wool_colour - All of the above are continuous variables. These last two parameters are discrete. For the colour, there are three options: brown, greyish or white, as I wanted to make it authentic sheep colours.
    earrings - I thought the sheep needed some detail, so I added two types of earrings, and then an option of no earrings.

I have now added in this one face to the arrangement to see the different randomness, and changed the liklihood of different random numbers, so it looks thoughtfully random. 

Working on for next time: **Arrangement**.
 - nose maybe should be bigger
 - when mouse goes on the sheep, it changes to shepherd and sheep get really happy. changes to sad face when mouse goes off of it. 
    - use mouseOver on image, and the function inside it will change the boolean variables faceHappy to true!!!
